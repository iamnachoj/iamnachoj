👋 Hi, I’m @iamnachoj

👀 I’m interested in developing business by optimal apps and websites.

🌱 I’m programming both client and server side, using React and the MERN stack to build quality user interfaces. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project that can lead to the growth of an existing product/service.

😎 I love coding, astronomy, travelling, trying new beers and DJing
